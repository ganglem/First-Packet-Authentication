\section{Abstract}
Cybersecurity and secure packet-based communication already start at the very first packet that is sent from one host to another.  The first packet builds the foundation for the following communication, and thus the initiation must be as secure as possible.  First Packet Authentication (FPA) describes a notion of how such security and authentication can take place.  \par
Methods like Port Knocking (PK), Single Packet Authorization (SPA) and BlackRidge Technology's Transport Access Control (TAC) provide such services.  All aim to ensure that the first packet sent is properly authenticated, authorized, and poses no threat to the target system.  This paper will describe and evaluate the methods as mentioned above of First Packet Authentication.\\\par
